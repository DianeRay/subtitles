ASS!

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
He's gonna take you back to the past

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,610
To play the shitty games that suck ass

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,910
He'd rather have a buffalo

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,930
Take a diarrhea dump in his ear

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,180
He'd rather eat the rotten asshole

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,390
Of a roadkill skunk and down it with beer

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,940
He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,230
He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,100
He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,280
He's the Angry Video Game Nerd

(explosions)

19
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,900
It's time to chill out. Nah, don't worry,

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,730
I'm not going mellow on you or anything like that.

21
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,980
And next time it's going to be a game review again.

22
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,130
But for now, I just want to take you back

23
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,860
to one of the most important parts of my childhood: Nintendo Power.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,840
You know, today there's Internet.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,770
Anything you want to know about any game, you just look it up.

26
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,840
But back then, your only source of information was magazines,

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,410
like Nintendo Power.

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,120
If you had a subscription, you were the man.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,870
One of your friends will be breaking their balls to beat some game

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,420
and you'll be like, "Oh, I know how to beat that game," or, "I know a code."

31
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,150
That's because you had the power!

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,410
Nintendo Power, motherfucker!

33
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,970
When it landed in my mailbox,

34
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,380
issue one was the most mind-blowing thing I've ever seen.

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,370
Just opening up a page to a map of Metroid, it was so helpful.

36
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,880
That game made you feel like a rat in a maze.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,860
Then there was the Super Mario Brothers unlimited 1-up trick,

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,729
the famous Contra code that gets you thirty extra lives,

39
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,960
and how to skip to Zelda's second quest.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,150
All in this groundbreaking issue;

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,940
from front cover to back, it is absolute classic.

42
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,610
One thing that used to piss me off was the NES Achiever section.

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,380
It's just a buncha nerds showing off their high scores.

44
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,889
But how do you prove it? You gotta take a photo of your screen.

45
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,500
And nobody really knew how to do that.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,979
I mean, remember, there were no digital cameras back then,

47
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,060
so, you take the picture of your screen,

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,020
you have no fucking clue what it looks like,

49
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,090
and there could be like 20 other pictures on the roll,

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,819
so you either have to, like, waste them all, or wait 'til it gets finished,

51
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,009
you get your mom or dad to take it to the store to get the picture developed,

52
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,560
it comes back and what does it look like? Looks like fucking shit!

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,940
So, Nintendo Power printed some guidelines basically saying,

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,539
"Look, dumb shits, this is how you do it."

55
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,410
And if my game said "cheese," I think I'd shit my pants.

56
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,680
And if I was wearing that, I'd have problems.

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,509
Nothing brings back memories like breezing through an issue of Nintendo Power.

58
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,800
Remember when the Nintendo 64 was the Nintendo Ultra 64?

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,020
Remember when the piece of shit Virtual Boy was called the VR-32?

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,240
Remember the NES Satellite, or the SNES Catapult?

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,030
Remember Star Fox 2, the game that never saw the light of day?

62
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,110
Remember reading about the new shows coming out,

63
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,340
like Captain N and The Super Mario Bros. Super Show?

64
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,099
Remember that shitty movie The Wizard,

65
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,849
and that fucking dumb-ass Super Mario Bros. movie?

66
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,729
Man, I remember reading about that and being so excited;

67
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,900
I couldn't WAIT to see that movie.

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,479
But it was just like waiting for a buffalo to take a shit all over your face.

69
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,770
Another thing powerful about this magazine

70
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,319
was the power to know what games were coming out.

71
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,759
But only if we could read between the lines we would know how shitty they'd be.

72
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,960
This one says, "in-depth playing tips on the horrifying sequel to Castlevania."

73
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,699
This one says Back to the Future

74
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:18,680
"has that distinctive LJN style and an interesting timer."

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
Wow. They knew it was bad.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,079
Another classic section was the Top 30,

77
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,850
in which they'd list the most popular Nintendo games.

78
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,380
I don't know what Ninja Turtles was doing at number one for so damn long.

79
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,069
But anyway, it was only NES for a while,

80
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:37,290
but then they started doing the top SNES and Game Boy games.

81
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,060
They even had a Top 5 for Virtual Boy.

82
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,519
That's just hilarious,

83
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,399
because that's almost the whole library of games for that fucking piece of shit.

84
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,730
The covers were always exciting to look forward to.

85
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,769
This one gave kids nightmares and parents complained.

86
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,100
I thought it was awesome.

87
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,170
And I never noticed that face in the background 'til today.

88
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,240
This one's cool because it's an owl, and owls are cool.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,060
But this one really sucks. Why is it all gray?

90
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,089
I mean, what the fuck kinda cover is this?

91
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,550
Oh. Well, what the fuck?

92
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,519
The illustrations were awesome too.

93
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,120
Even if I didn't have the game, it was fun just looking at the pictures.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,130
Here's a page on Clash at Demonhead.

95
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,860
Just a nice page, everything's fine,

96
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,300
but then there's something that bothered me.

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,610
What's this?! He's flippin' the bird!

98
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,100
He's givin' the finger! And I'm not making this up.

99
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,370
Well, this one's kinda intimidating. I mean, what's Dracula's problem?

100
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:39,019
(Castlevania II night theme plays)

101
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,889
Speaking of illustrations, there were also the comics.

102
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,490
Howard and Nester were classic.

103
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,730
Usually it would relate to a new game that was coming out;

104
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,860
like, this one's about Castlevania II;

105
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,300
it even makes mention of that weird tornado thing.

106
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,000
There was also a Tetris comic, Battletoads, Zelda, Mario, Star Fox,

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,269
Metroid, Shadows of the Empire, and Killer Instinct.

108
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,790
The ads were kinda weird.

109
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,750
This kid better be careful not to get those games wet.

110
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,839
Actually, those games suck ass, throw 'em to the sharks.

111
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,279
Wow, there you go! Huddle around the phone.

112
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,480
Charge your parents' phone bill up the ass.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,490
Unmask the power animal in you! Uh-oh, here we go!

114
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,420
And radicalize your game with a subscription to Nintendo Power!

115
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,759
Holy shit, will it make me grow claws like that?

116
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
You know it's gotta be awesome when you're flying a Jeep through space

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,529
going apeshit with Nintendo controllers.

118
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,970
This one's so weird somebody actually wrote a letter asking,

119
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,410
"Did you really freeze a Super Nintendo? I'd love to know."

120
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,579
The answer, "Ah, Jay, the wonders of special effects and photographic tricks!

121
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,130
"The answer that you're looking for is 'No.'

122
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,120
The block of ice is actually just a plastic shell. It's way cool though, huh?"

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,089
As Nintendo Power progressed, the ads went from being weird,

124
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,529
to just being... fucking disgusting.

125
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,319
Why the hell is there a picture of a jar of toenail clippings

126
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,199
in a video game magazine?

127
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,829
What where they thinking?

128
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,670
Now here's the worst one yet.

129
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,910
It's some old creepy bitch holding a log of shit! God damn!

130
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,110
One ad was so gross, I stapled the page shut. I'm actually not joking.

131
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,050
Then this one just shows a hurl bag. Yeah, that's great.

132
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,620
That just sums up how I feel about the whole situation.

133
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,170
Nintendo Power! Don't open unless you got a barf bag!

134
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,160
(vomiting noises)

135
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,290
Each issue always came with a poster.

136
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,060
As you can see, I still have them on my walls,

137
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,730
but each one represents frustration.

138
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,839
Getting these things out without ripping the fuck out of the poster

139
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,120
is just a real shit sucker.

140
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,300
Ah, fuck!

141
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,050
Ah, shit. Fuck.

142
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,100
Eventually they started putting staples in the posters.

143
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,709
Fuck!

144
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,120
Piece of shit!

145
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,779
Besides the posters, there was a lot of stupid shit,

146
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,300
like this Donkey Kong iron-on t-shirt.

147
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,589
And this weird scratch-and-sniff Earthbound thing.

148
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,709
Oh, dat stinks!

149
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,550
Then there was also these cards in the back. I mean, what's the point?

150
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,880
Star Fox looks fucking pissed.

151
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,090
Speaking of Star Fox, there was also this fighter jet paper cutout model.

152
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,279
Then there were those Magic Eye pictures.

153
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,409
You're supposed to stare at this thing and see Mario or something.

154
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't see shit.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,259
There was also a contest in every issue.

156
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,870
Grand prizes would include a sneak showing of the Ninja Turtles movie,

157
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,070
a chance to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger,

158
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,809
to win Bill and Ted's phone booth,

159
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:52,360
to win a Street Fighter II arcade machine, to dig up dinosaurs,

160
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,149
or to be an extra in The Mask II.

161
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,600
The Mask II?

162
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Oh, that's a great prize! That movie never got fucking made,

163
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
unless you count Son of Mask, but that wasn't 'til about ten years later,

164
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,539
and did they give the winner a rain check for that?

165
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,019
To be in a movie with a computer generated baby,

166
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,000
or any of the other sequels to Jim Carrey movies that don't have Jim Carrey?

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,440
Then there's this prize. It's just plain weird.

168
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,519
"Have you ever dreamed of yourself in a tropical paradise,

169
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,669
surrounded by sea and sand, a volcano rising at your back?"

170
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,779
Well, not if it's erupting like in the picture.

171
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,130
"It's tropical, dude!" There's the sun. I don't really see the sun.

172
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,539
There's fun--oh, that's where the fun is, right there? Surf? OK.

173
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,169
Uh, you? You're right there? OK.

174
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:40,159
Sand? Well, that is definitely sand.

175
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,029
And trees? Yep, uh, there are trees, all over the place.

176
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,769
There was also a contest to design enemies for future Mega Man games.

177
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,809
Some of the entries would include Balloon Man, Sun Man, Yo-Yo Man,

178
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:58,809
Spring Man, Magic Man, Clock Man, Whip Man, Spook Man, Clown Man,

179
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:02,610
and the only two female characters were Mega Woman and Mega Girl.

180
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,840
Then there's... Weaseletta and Terror Teddy?

181
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,519
What the fuck?

182
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,340
Nintendo Power was great,

183
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,360
but as it went on, they made some dumb decisions.

184
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,820
It was really nice when the spines were all numbered,

185
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,929
so I can easily organize all the issues, but then... what the fuck?!

186
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,559
That's so inconvenient.

187
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,049
I mean, some of them didn't even have the number on the front cover.

188
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,799
You had to open it to find out.

189
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,639
Then they came back to their senses and brought the spines back

190
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,480
with a picture of Mario. Way to go above and beyond.

191
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,580
So, let's read some letters.

192
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,929
Here somebody asks, "Do your Nintendo tapes only last five years?

193
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,049
Does it matter if you set them on chairs or if you put the controllers on the floor?"

194
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,549
Huh.

195
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:47,490
Here somebody sent in a recipe for Mike Tyson's Punch.

196
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,990
Oh, that's funny.

197
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh, and oh my God, here we go, we got a Zelda rap.

198
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,169
(rapping)
♫ It's the Legend of Zelda and it's really bad ♫

199
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,059
♫ The creatures in the game are really rad ♫

200
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,769
This sounds familiar.

201
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,090
All right, now we got some Mario jokes.

202
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,950
"Why did Mario cross the road? Because he couldn't find a warp zone."

203
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,779
"What kind of fish would dare to attack Mario? A Barakoopa."

204
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,649
"How does Mario know what will happen in the future? He uses a Luigi board."

205
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,990
Aw, God.

206
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,380
All right, now we got some Zelda jokes.

207
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,600
"How did Link win the basketball game for his team? He used his Hookshot."

208
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,570
"What did Zelda tell Link when he couldn't unlock the door? Triforce."

209
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,940
"What did Link say to Ganon when he captured Zelda? Leever alone!"

210
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,620
OK, here's a really weird one.

211
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,580
"If Mario Paint has 41,664 dots available

212
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,559
"(judging from page 112 of the Mario Paint Player's Guide),

213
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,039
"and 15 different colors to choose from,

214
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,990
"then did you know that there a total of,

215
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:58,539
"1, uh, 97885712197941 (repeats 'oh' quickly)

216
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:01,380
"different possible images to create on a single page?

217
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,059
That's a lot, eh? Just thought I'd tell you."

218
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:09,139
"Uh... thanks, Ian. That's certainly some useful information."

219
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,039
Now we got some complaints.

220
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,100
"The game I purchased that was completely different than I expected

221
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,850
"was Rambo for the NES.

222
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,259
"I saw him firing a machine gun on the package and it looked really cool.

223
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,740
"So I bought it. When I got home I started to play the game.

224
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,460
"It was boring. All you do is walk around and fight with a knife.

225
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,389
The only enemies I met were spiders, gorillas, bugs, et cetera."

226
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,330
Tell me about it. We'll get to that one some time.

227
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,230
Ooh, ooh, here we go.

228
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,139
"I once bought a game from a friend called Fester's Quest.

229
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,250
"I was expecting a great game after reading about it in Nintendo Power.

230
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,139
"But even with the magazine at my side,

231
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,320
"it took me two and a half hours to make it to the first boss

232
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,350
and another two to make it to the second."

233
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,700
You wanna know about Fester's Quest? Next time.

234
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,590
Oh, here's a good complaint.

235
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,169
"So, nice names guys, Mario 64, Super Mario Kart 64, Pilotwings 64,

236
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:05,600
"Wave Race 64, Killer Instinct 64, and the list goes on. Yeeeeeesh!

237
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,620
"I'm not really mad, but I think you guys

238
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,799
could at least put some effort into the names of the games."

239
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,269
He totally has a good point, but here's the response:

240
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,419
"So you're saying you wouldn't be in favor of our plan

241
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:19,980
to rename the magazine Nintendo Power 64?"

242
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,080
Wow, what an asshole.

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,850
"It is quite apparent what an active and important role

244
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,980
"marketing plays in the video game industry.

245
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,250
"I have to wonder what you are thinking

246
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,740
"when marketing the Nintendo 64 to elementary school gamers.

247
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,279
"You risk alienating gamers 15 and up.

248
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,860
"You should target older gamers, because you'll also target younger ones,

249
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,139
"since the audience perception of 'coolness'

250
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:44,639
often depends on what the older, teenage audience thinks is cool."

251
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,269
I agree. And the response?

252
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,220
"Your suggestion inspired us to target more teens with our marketing,

253
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,380
so tune in to a very special episode of 'Friends' this week to see--"

254
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,370
OK, here's my letter.

255
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,789
