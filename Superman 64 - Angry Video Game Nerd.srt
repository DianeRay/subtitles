00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,960
 He is on his journey through time 

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,480
 He is on his journey through time 

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,860
 and play the shitty games of yore. 

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,780
 Rather, he could be of a buffalo 

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,960
 his entire ear with Sprühstuhl befüll'n. 

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,500
 He would rather the rotting ass 

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,960
 a run over skunk licking and runterspül'n with beer. 

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,760
 A more furious gamer you have not heard before. 

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,320
 He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd. 

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,880
 He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd. 

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,640
 He's the Angry Video Game Nerd. 

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,380
 Okay, the wait is finally over. 

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,160
 The review wants to see everyone. 

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,340
 Here it is: Superman ... 

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,039
 On the Commodore 64 

18
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,300
 That you thought surely, the Commodore 64 One of the best-selling home computer of the 80s. 

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,060
 The games were on floppies. Do you know the more that were still really wobbly? 

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,360
 We plug the fucker in there, turn on the bastard and play a little Superman. 

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,140
 This is the start screen. Without the instructions you were quite in a fix here. 

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,200
 You must then press Return LOAD "*", 8,1 and enter. 

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,200
 Then there is short black and a few seconds later "Superman is loaded." 

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,860
 At least you know then that you have it done properly. 

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,160
 Then you have but to wait until the shit part has loaded. 

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,380
 Do you remember, in the early CD-based consoles like the PlayStation 

27
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,500
 where you had to wait for whatever load times? 

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,780
 This is again of NEM completely different caliber. 

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,099
 This part needs it actually 2:07 minutes. 

30
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,459
 I admit it, I've measured. 

31
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:53,099
 Then the title screen comes with the music and you think to yourself "WOW!" 

32
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:54,580
 But what is it? 

33
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,959
 "Give the character from column 9, line 10 shows"? 

34
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,380
 Oh come on, I need so ne code table. 

35
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,560
 Yes, ne code table. Compare the stupid numbers and there you have it: it is the 5th 

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 WHAT DO I NEED TO MAKE stuff like that? 

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,620
 So choose the difficulty level and before you know it, it must have been reloaded! 

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,800
 54 seconds this time, not necessarily long, but one seems like half an eternity. 

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,520
 Then you can get such a comic story and then ... you stupid fucking part! 

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,620
 Presumably one is two weeks later, after you finally can start playing times, 

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,160
 quite surprised that the video actually looks quite good and the controls are self-explanatory. 

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,979
 It just flies around and Ballert broken stuff. 

43
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,240
 You do not run around as Clark Kent, find underground tunnel or something a fuck. 

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,699
 So it's actually better than the Nintendo version. 

45
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,020
 But that has not much to say. 

46
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,160
 As if the shit last night was better than the shit from the day before. 

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
 The controller is fully Asspen. 

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,280
 But at least you can replace the against an Atari or Sega Mega Drive controller. 

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,900
 Is not that amazing? 

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,780
 The first level has a 3D perspective and in the second one protects a ship from Asteoroiden. 

51
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,800
 This one is more like a space shooter. 

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,199
 The third level is like a sidescroller, variety is thus available. 

53
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,139
 But this must be one of nervtötendsten level in the history of video games! 

54
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,780
 Each hit you will be thrown back! 

55
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,120
 Crap! 

56
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,460
 Damn! 

57
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,960
 Shit! 

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,479
 SHIT! 

59
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,340
 Sick of the dirt! 

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,880
 But wait, that's not what you want to see, I want to see THE here, right? 

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,620
 Oh come on, you really want me to play it? 

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,919
 Well, I do it only to please you. Because I really like to have you. 

63
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,919
 Take the merely not too serious! 

64
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,680
 Here we go! I turn it on! 

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,020
 First, you are greeted by a smiling cartoon fox. 

66
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,400
 "Titus"? What that? 

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,180
 The official title of the game is simply "Superman". 

68
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,080
 But since each game title on the N64 ended on 64, it is not surprising that it enjoys the same reputation. 

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,940
 The first thing that bothers me is this standard music ... 

70
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,560
 Why not the Superman theme? You know that. John Williams 

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,740
 The have the fewest games anyway! 

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,880
 Once the game starts you have to fly through rings. 

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,479
 I did not even get used to the control the time. 

74
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,919
 One would think that if the game has one starts a little room to fly around and look around. 

75
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,180
 But no, you have to fly through the rings! 

76
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,740
 And woe to you fucked up! 

77
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,259
 If you have more than, I think, missed three or so, no idea, sometimes two or four's. 

78
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:26,560
 I'm not quite sure, but in any case, if you miss a couple of rings you have to start from scratch. 

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,500
 And you try again and again until it works and on top of that there's still a time limit! 

80
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,579
 Since it is the very first level one would think that this is still a bit loose. 

81
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:43,139
 Forget it! The time is just enough so the whole hinzukriegen perfect. 

82
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,160
 It might look that I am feathering as a buffoon, but the controls are totally stupid. 

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,620
 You must be very precise to deal with the joystick, otherwise flying Superman sometimes just somewhere else entirely. 

84
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,040
 And if you want to fly a sharp turn to fly across the whole map. 

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,579
 You know the worth sure all better than me and it is hardly the mention of, 

86
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:04,959
 but this game is atrocious! 

87
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,819
 And you know what that is all-embarrassing? 

88
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,279
 The game is not even TEN years old! 

89
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,940
 Just how it is. One would think there were around 1999 already certain quality standards. 

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,000
 What? I firmly hang? How the hell can I get stuck? I am under the bridge! 

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,100
 It looks as if Superman jerk his Superschniedel. 

92
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,459
 Of course, you are under pressure when a game requires a one-time limit. 

93
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,500
 You can fly through any of these rings with peace or patience, you have to keep moving. 

94
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,779
 If you miss a ring one has to turn the dial and still to bring him, 

95
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,839
 so you have to expect no consequences unless you skip it and fetches the next. 

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:45,199
 But if you decide to turn around and get him, you have already wasted so much time, 

97
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,180
 So it is pretty much out of it the same if you just misses him. 

98
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,600
 You MUST continue to fly! If you start rumzueiern you no longer creates it within the time. 

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,839
 Watched? I have too much rumgeblödelt. So I can just as well give up and kill me. 

100
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,980
 Do you see as the building? I crash because now purely full pot. 

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,740
 Well, then it has nothing at all times brought! 

102
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,940
 You can not even commit suicide? Not at all! 

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,740
 It simply depends only in the air until the time runs out. 

104
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,940
 The only thing worse than an unspeakably verhunztes game is not even to have a choice to commit suicide. 

105
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,139
 What does that fidgeting? Can I beat up anyone in this Kackspiel? 

106
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,740
 I'll probably never find out, but why see these blows so disabled? 

107
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,300
 You want to piss me well! I hang already fixed again? 

108
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,519
 I'm not even in the sewing - looks like a lot of space! Look at the place! 

109
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,579
 How can I hang if there is sooo vieeel place? 

110
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,839
 15 seconds, and I've almost done. 

111
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,339
 Almost there! Oh shit, I missed tion ring. Oh come on! War I do not have a try? 

112
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,139
 Oh man, what's he doing now? Stretching exercises? 

113
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,699
 This is so pathetic. This game is not just bad, it is incredibly bad! 

114
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,579
 Oh, we should not fool ourselves, it's a bunch of steaming horse shit! 

115
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,639
 Almost there, less than ten seconds. 

116
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,540
 Come on, I can still just create so. Since the last ring! 

117
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,959
 Damn arschgefickter shit Hurenmösenfurz! I do not believe it! Because of the one ring! 

118
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,519
 Oh, that's Asspen, something of Asspen! 

119
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,120
 Oh, this time I'll get it! Only four seconds! Shit! YES! 

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,480
 NEEEEEEIN! That did not count! 

121
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,899
 So when I finally get the rings have left behind me, dive quickly to instructions and disappear. 

122
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,079
 What was there? Something to do with cars. You do not get time enough time to read. 

123
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,160
 Oh, it's already over? What I should have done that? 

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,339
 WHAT? I can not even try it again? 

125
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,699
 I HAVE AGAIN BY THE RINGS FLY SHIT! 

126
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,540
 I can not believe that I'm playing a Superman game where you do nothing but fly through rings! 

127
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,079
 At first I thought that would be the training mode to practice aiming. 

128
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,480
 Many games have that, eg Starfox on the Super Nintendo. 

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,279
 There's also nen training mode where you fly through rings. 

130
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,480
 But even then does not all get one, it's more about how many you get one after the other. 

131
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,440
 In the actual game you are flying through the area, ballert from enemies and avoid obstacles. 

132
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,300
 So what the fuck is this? 

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,079
 One should rather beat up nasty types 

134
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,680
 and do not ever put his flying skills with one of the most miserable controls prove! 

135
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,899
 There is even a practice mode. 

136
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,720
 And just out of pure curiosity I once tried it to see what it is and three guesses. 

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
 Fly through rings, jup. What else? 

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,279
 So I am arrived back at the next part. 

139
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,899
 The message remains just a second on the screen. 

140
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,519
 And then you have six seconds for whatever. 

141
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,680
 Fuck! Back at the rings back. 

142
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,259
 If I had two consecutive trials, perhaps I would sometimes figure out what I should do. 

143
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,059
 But instead, I am so surprised that I've managed to 

144
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,100
 than that I can respond to something within six seconds, without being able to read what I should do. 

145
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,980
 And I really do this to me? Is that a Superman game 

146
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,620
 in which you can fly only by rings? 

147
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,860
 What better is that not invaded? 

148
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,259
 That would be like a Batman game, in which he plays Hüpfekästchen. 

149
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,259
 Okay, it's time for the six-second auto-level. 

150
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:58,759
 Way! Go away since! 

151
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,880
 All right, I got the car. And now? 

152
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
 Oh, the clock has to eleven seconds reset. All well and good, but what do I do with the car? 

153
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,960
 There's another car, I can stop it? 

154
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,259
 Oh, that sucks. The. Is. Shit. 

155
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:14,659
 Basically, you have to stop the car before they drive people to the ground. 

156
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,659
 But guess what comes next? 

157
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,659
 Even more rings! 

158
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,279
 And then you have to pick up a patrol car and contribute to the goal. 

159
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,460
 I urge here slow on a pattern. 

160
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,700
 Fly through rings, pick up cars, drag back by rings and more cars. 

161
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,100
 So I come to the finish and three guesses what comes next. 

162
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,840
 Seriously, guess what comes next. 

163
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,320
 Even more rings. Right. 

164
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,840
 What is this game? Is that something like a psychological test? 

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,279
 I've had enough of it at any rate, more of it I did not pack. 

166
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
 This game qualifies as not even shit. 

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
 This is more of a shit shit Kackbatzens. 

168
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,019
 This is so unspeakably and so shockingly bad! 

169
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,059
 It is abhorrent and repugnant racking a brain! 

170
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,860
 There is one big pile of shit and does not belong on this planet! 

171
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,000
 Someone has to bother about! This looks like a job for the fucking nerd!  Subtitles End: mo.dbxdb.com
