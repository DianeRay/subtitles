Youtube subtitles download by mo.dbxdb.com 

2
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:29,585
 The Terminator 2 movie right candidate for the "best resume ever made" address 

3
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,268
 and "Best Action and Sci-Fi Film 'title as well. 

4
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,385
 Wherever you look, it's a masterpiece. 

5
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,315
 Naturally, the video games they wanted to ride the success 

6
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:40,310
 therefore, have appeared on the market. 

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,970
 It is likely that what most of us know, the arcade version of Midway onwards. 

8
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,996
 We can now re-ported Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo. 

9
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,766
 The gameplay does not need a lot of sense: 

10
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,264
 just move the cursor on the screen, and shoot anything that moves. 

11
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,286
 Except the Companions of the way they are because they are dirty. 

12
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,653
 Well, hear! I did not know that Gold terminators are doing. 

13
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:04,738
 Defeating the Boss mindless butchers ground. More bullets to beleeresztened, 

14
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:08,174
 than you can imagine. Just shoot, shoot and shoot. 

15
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:11,340
 The Genesis version is similar to ROB the robot! (For an additional NES) 

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,610
 Essentially the same game, but with minor changes. 

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,642
 And some of the sound effects are right. 

18
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:22,099
 The Super Nintendo version, and if the soldiers is shot, I shout: No! 

19
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,385
 Which is pretty lame. 

20
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,013
 But the Genesis version, just yell. 

21
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:29,522
 Tremendous progress ... 

22
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:33,360
 Sticking out from under the horse's feet some animation. Look at the barrel! The flames did not move. 

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,119
 Unlike the Super Nintendo's version, collect items from the first track. 

24
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,418
 So ... um ... small refrigerator are looking for things. It seems that you never run out! 

25
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:45,794
 Yet many current half power for such a small box? 

26
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:48,746
 The worst part is when you have to protect John Connor. 

27
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:51,809
 All that happens is always to kill, and you lose. 

28
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,016
 A meaningless game, but in its day it was a real standard. 

29
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:57,438
 The home consoles wanted to take advantage of it. 

30
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,258
 The Super Scope pal and Sega Menacer per year. 

31
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,821
 But where is really worth playing, that was the game room. 

32
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,672
 Moreover, even for GameBoy also átportolták. 

33
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:06,677
 Now that's pathetic! 

34
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:09,995
 Now comes the Terminator 2 NES. 

35
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,205
 Everything begins with the death of small rainbow ... 

36
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:17,925
 I swear, I do not want to be prejudiced, but a lot of freakin crap LJN game released! 

37
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:23,703
 All Terminator 2 game console in seeing them, even the arcade transcripts as well. 

38
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:26,948
 "The LJN proudly presents". So to sum I pay! 

39
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:32,443
 Of course this is a different kind of gameplay it offers compared to the arcade version. 

40
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,624
 The first track. You're the Terminator, and a truck Stopped hitting people. 

41
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,078
 Pointless speculation is the whole key presses, in addition eltalnod need them often, 

42
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:40,043
 to die. 

43
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,232
 I just need to run to from them. 

44
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:47,412
 But you can not. Do you know why? Because the quest to hit everyone out on the track. 

45
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,829
 The sound effects are totally sucking. Only: 

46
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,419
 There is no difference between having just hit the air, or if you hit someone. 

47
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,436
 You could not have two distinct sound effects to create? 

48
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,855
 God, it lasts for eternity! 

49
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:09,870
 If among you, shoot it. But even if all of them on one page cheat, 

50
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,982
 sit together and you can often get hit. 

51
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:16,791
 This is only the first part of the game, and you've got it I'm sick of fucking! 

52
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,616
 Then you go to the pub as the first scenes of the film. 

53
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,805
 Again, all you need to shock him, but constantly pouring from the bar. 

54
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,712
 Yet how many are there? 

55
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:28,217
 Then you get to the main enemy. Just who is this guy? 

56
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,959
 Higher you while you're in the Terminator? 

57
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,355
 Arnold "Fucking" Schwarzenegger? 

58
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:36,075
 But it is not the size of the point, is not it? 

59
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:41,052
 Look, I died. Canned feet from a Terminator, a machine with his bare hands! 

60
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,130
 Well this is odabasz. 

61
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,821
 If you crouch down, you can not hit. Gyepálhatom So as long as I want. 

62
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:50,044
 But it can last forever, and do not think that is damaged by shocks. 

63
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,060
 So why put a character in the game who behaves as if it gets damaged, 

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,423
 While you seem to be fine? 

65
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:57,842
 It seems like you get out of him ... 

66
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:00,835
 It can kill, but with a little patience is necessary. 

67
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:04,586
 The second track. This is the only track where you sit on the bike. 

68
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:08,098
 Something you should know: you need to shoot the gate, otherwise it will end collision. 

69
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:12,864
 Once shot, you still have, if not completely in the middle of lime. 

70
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:16,399
 Reminds me of Bart Vs. from the World, the Great Wall of China when Bart roams change. 

71
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,920
 I hated that shit! 

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,562
 But the most annoying thing in the truck! From the bottom of the screen will be in it, at heart! 

73
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,589
 Yet what is it, a magnet on the front? 

74
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:28,115
 First of all, when I played, fart was not what I should do. 

75
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:32,124
 I was thinking that we should speed up, but I could not find a way to succeed. 

76
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:36,922
 Finally I realized that I can shoot back. All you have to do is you shoot the truck, 

77
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:44,202
 as if ... then rolled forward. But to shoot the truck, and the ride is quite annoying to watch. 

78
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,990
 Then save John Connor, and you must swear not to kill anyone. 

79
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,391
 So, come the third track where the hospital trying to save Sarah. 

80
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:56,363
 It should not to shoot anyone unless lábonlövöd. 

81
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:00,637
 It is quite clear, but damn stupid comes out to be always squat. 

82
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:04,478
 I mean, this is the first side-scrolling field, where a gun, 

83
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,149
 and you can not kill anyone. 

84
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:07,028
 The fourth track. The Cyberdine in or 

85
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:09,959
 and the mission is to fly in the air the place up. 

86
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,403
 You pace back up to gyüjtögess bombs, which looks like ... 

87
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:15,706
 I do not know. A headless chicken that just takes a dead rat? 

88
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,987
 Why not? Do not you see? 

89
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:17,170
 I do not know. 

90
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,809
 I work up the bombs, and lays them some crap store or something. 

91
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,228
 And I think that's all, right? 

92
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:26,274
 Is not it! Who should consider the bombs and reassemble them at the place specified. 

93
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:30,476
 Okay, well what's the point of this? Why could not only collect the bombs 

94
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:33,696
 and eat your position where you? I can only imagine what they thought: 

95
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,713
 "Gonna put the bomb into the 'lookin' guy." 

96
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:37,817
 Okay, and then what? 

97
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:41,930
 "Why do not you take out back and put down somewhere else?" 

98
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,168
 Like dog new tricks! "Go to Ager, get, get back!" Little fuckers ... 

99
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,079
 The fifth track nightmare. 

100
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,168
 Wherever you go, mobile platforms have to jump. 

101
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:56,428
 The pontosságodnak should be better than perfect, or you're dead. 

102
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:57,302
 Fuck! 

103
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:58,824
 It is almost impossible! 

104
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:02,891
 Eljátszatja you the idea that comes down the chain. But no! 

105
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:07,245
 It's a big jump, amekkorát possible. But the platform does not stay down for long enough. 

106
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:12,980
 We're just a microsecond is to act! In addition there is a ball of fire! 

107
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,615
 Leghúzósabb snapped this one life. 

108
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:22,394
 Another jump like a glitch or something. Oh come on! It really killed? 

109
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:24,882
 The pipe arrived, not the lava. 

110
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:29,057
 If you kill the tube arrival, then why not look like it is lava? 

111
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,793
 And with what's going on here? That's a platform? 

112
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:37,418
 So what the fuck looks like a platform? Here then are in serious trouble ... 

113
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,017
 Finally duel T-1000. The bare your hands. 

114
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:44,132
 Unless you left your ammo from Cyberdine, 

115
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:47,634
 because there is no ammunition in the whole track! Not one ounce! 

116
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:51,738
 So if you have no ammo, just rely on your hand. 

117
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:55,117
 At least it would be a place where felpakolhatsz ammo! 

118
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:59,007
 Because it is the Last Battle! If you look at a game in the Castlevania-series 

119
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:04,298
 before you fight Dracula, you can spend a certain place again. 

120
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,173
 It is true that a secret, but it's there. In addition, there are guns in the hallway. 

121
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,870
 But here you do not get my ass either! 

122
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,107
 After the T-1000 in the lava pushed him win. 

123
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:19,370
 Then check out the last spots. It seems that every key scene 

124
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,874
 have been in the game, which is commendable, but being left out of the Terminator theme song 

125
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,779
 still amaze. 

126
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,745
 For now the Terminator 2 on GameBoy! 

127
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:31,988
 By portable console not expect a lot in graphics, 

128
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:37,684
 but resolved quite nicely. John Connor will shape the future, who just last Skynet. 

129
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:41,144
 The first track seems simple, until you reach the end of the lézersorompót. 

130
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:45,769
 Of course, you leave to the left to find out what you should do. 

131
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,011
 Then you realize that these towers kill the task. 

132
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:51,834
 After you blew them all, there is still a barrier. 

133
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:56,622
 In fact, it should be firing them from highest to lowest! 

134
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,384
 What a bunch of random crap! 

135
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:03,372
 The second track of Skynet in you, which is pretty obvious. 

136
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:06,528
 But these bombs on the ground well fuck him up! 

137
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,297
 I can not shoot them, and I can not jump over them. 

138
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:13,863
 Oh yeah. Do you know of three games without a life and Resume? 

139
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:18,817
 So here there is only one life! Once you die, the game is over. 

140
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:23,052
 I think that végigvidd the game so that you do not die, just crazy! 

141
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:27,999
 At the end of the second track to be the Terminator program it is. 

142
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,774
 Okay ... well, so did John Connor? 

143
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:33,561
 I never think that the history of this part of the play is written. 

144
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,014
 In essence, the wires should be tied to the circuit to work. 

145
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:42,159
 But there is a time limit! And you can always go down, when you start to figure out what to do. 

146
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,095
 You can not pause the game, it goes blank. 

147
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:51,381
 Here there are at least two options. But if you fuck up twice, then I've failed. 

148
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:57,678
 In the last game. Thank fucking God. Terminator 2 on the Super Nintendo. 

149
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,083
 And includes the Terminator headline? 

150
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,951
 No. Of course not. 

151
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,278
 Just a remastered version of ... crap 

152
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,072
 How many would do so Terminator game that was removed from the headlines? 

153
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,711
 The only thing that was in it, the Sega CD version. 

154
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:19,523
 If you look at the demo, you will see as a naked Arnold goes to the bar, 

155
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,668
 sensors and show the style of Austin Powers! 

156
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,205
 Now that's funny! 

157
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:25,211
 If you press START, you can skip the whole thing. 

158
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:29,028
 Then you have to dress and hang around together and back to hitting people. 

159
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,134
 I can only say: Oh, my God! 

160
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,138
 The management is very bad! 

161
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:39,769
 It is very hard, and you can not beat anybody if you're too close to them. 

162
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:40,437
 But watch the jump! 

163
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:46,857
 Yet what is good? Like some kind of disability, or as if an invisible rope pulling. 

164
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:50,581
 The bitch sky, now that's damn odabasz! Note that push: 

165
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:53,658
 God ... 

166
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:58,293
 I do not see the point. You can not make a joke esre something so random! 

167
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:02,424
 A very hard of someone who is the Terminator, they did a complete joke. 

168
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,947
 Well, that's a joke! 

169
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:08,000
 I did not do it because it's funny, but it is very slow walk. 

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,813
 The only way to move faster when jumping like an idiot! 

171
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,402
 Unlike the Nes version is not the one mission that leüss everyone. 

172
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:20,427
 You'll never run out. What a joke is when someone pretend: 

173
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:24,164
 "Hey, try it! Kill the guys! "It's definitely going to sit there forever! 

174
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:27,735
 The mission is to find a pistol and a rifle. 

175
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:30,726
 But that's not enough, you have to find John Connor's phone number. 

176
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:33,024
 But it's still not enough, because "objects in its future" must be collected! 

177
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:39,312
 I do not know what these things. But small coolers, first aid and similar crates. 

178
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:43,655
 I do not remember them from the movie, so why should such a force in the game? 

179
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,672
 If you have never played the game before, I'd think 

180
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:50,501
 If you find these objects, you also were collected. 

181
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,706
 But no! Them to be kept as a gun and shoot them. 

182
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:57,373
 Look at the briefing! He says: "Collect objects in Future" 

183
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:02,379
 So when I think of the collection means that you have to shoot the shit out of them 

184
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,511
 I can not write there is more to 'Destroy objects in its future? " 

185
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:10,006
 Which was not very fun, is that although the pieces explode for no reason. 

186
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,149
 Even the waitress attacked you! 

187
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,812
 All human beings turn off the game will be finished before the first pitch. 

188
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,350
 I go the whole hog to succeed, then I got this: 

189
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,750
 The small engine - if you believe, if you do not - you're in! 

190
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,375
 Can not be distinguished from the others. When I gave first-time, 

191
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,443
 died soon before he was figuring a chance to know what to do. 

192
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,058
 Oh and by the way: a Life. 

193
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:39,616
 Yeah Die once, and it's all over. 

194
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,447
 It clung to the formulation, is not it? 

195
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,192
 Play through the game in one breath! It's inconceivable. 

196
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:51,315
 Man, collided with the truck engine. And the truck exploded! 

197
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:55,746
 I must say, I still do not know how to control it. 

198
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,690
 The biggest problem is that I do not know how to turn around. 

199
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,735
 Somehow, they'd have to hold the D-pad, and the Ypszilont, 

200
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:06,729
 but just could not get the hang of. I can say without hesitation: 

201
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:11,068
 This is without a doubt the worst conductor part I've ever played. 

202
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:15,288
 Roger Rabbit was bad, Dick Tracy terrible. 

203
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:17,048
 Then I thought this was the worst. 

204
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,207
 But after playing with ... 

205
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,505
 this takes the cake! 

206
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:28,811
 I could only get so far, and that's Terminator game you have to play with. 

207
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:33,355
 Well, the worst with this prize won. 

208
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:37,552
 Of all the Terminator games are the worst! 

209
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:43,811
 Based on the criteria, here are the limits of the NES, Super NES and abilities. 

210
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:47,716
 Did you ever think that the Super NES version will be even worse? 

211
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:52,485
 In addition, this is the sequel! So there's no excuse for being worse. 

212
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:56,375
 Do yourself a favor and never-never play this game! 

213
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,384
 Because "there is no fate, but if you can finish the work." (The first sentence legendary film) 

214
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:02,452
 Choose the good fate and defeat this Fost hat! 

215
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:14,938
 Good-bye, baby ... 

216
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:25,000
