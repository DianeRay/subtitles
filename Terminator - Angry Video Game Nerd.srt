00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,389
 Possible responses: It sucks! No way! Oh no! What a piece of dog shit! Go to hell! 

11
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:52,438
 What a piece of dog shit! 

12
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:57,126
 Make games in the first Terminator movie? What an opportunity! 

13
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:03,670
 The film was a film-noir-like, was in action, science fiction, time travel, and it is well kneaded. 

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,721
 But the game is like macskahúgyot, horse shit and disznóhányást been kneaded together! 

15
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,554
 Yeah! This is a blender that you do not want to. 

16
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,160
 So if this game from them, will surely give you a stroke. 

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,154
 But do not worry! Because now is the time to lay the demons! 

18
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:23,159
 Because the battle for the past will take place in the present! 

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,538
 Here and now! 

20
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,004
 Man, it's too dark. I'd rather just start the game! 

21
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:35,185
 As you notice, the Terminator or not. 

22
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:38,001
 Kyle Reese or in the future, which will probably be the best idea. 

23
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,946
 But look at the gafikát! So I call this 8-bit vomit ... 

24
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:47,875
 Together, jumping back half missing bricks, pipes and projections. 

25
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,144
 Yet what is it? Super Mario Brothers? 

26
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:53,360
 The background is just gray bricks random mush. 

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,625
 Pretty depressing to look at. 

28
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,991
 Maybe I wrong? 

29
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,140
 The NES would do would not last enough to color? 

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,155
 The upper display is quite monochromatic, only black, white and green. 

31
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:04,671
 Look at the vitality of the strip! 

32
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,998
 The black shows the ténlyeges guilds, while green shows sold out in hand, 

33
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:10,367
 which is kind of confusing, because if you look at it, 

34
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,663
 I'm not sure, but I feel that the other way around. 

35
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:16,313
 The music is unacceptable. Listen! 

36
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:23,605
 Still, what would you call this? 

37
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:26,093
 It's only a five-second melody, which is repeated continuously 

38
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,345
 Sound effects are barely. 

39
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:31,028
 Pretty bad effect on the listener. 

40
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,996
 If your ears hányhatnának, you can do anything. 

41
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:37,319
 Now I want to talk to the management. 

42
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,317
 Dear God, well fucked up. 

43
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:42,392
 If you want to jump, first you get into the squatting posture 

44
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,782
 Probably the most late jump I've ever met. 

45
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:48,372
 The gun is even worse! 

46
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:52,173
 If you press A, and then you get into the squat position. 

47
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,724
 We call this "weapon mode". 

48
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:59,214
 If this "weapon mode" or the shot will be launched with the D-pad and célozhatsz. 

49
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:00,805
 Well, let me summarize: 

50
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:07,989
 You can not shoot when you stand, you can not shoot when you squat - as do otherwise - and if you can not shoot jump! 

51
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,122
 This is in contrast to all the usual stuff that works side-scrolling games, lövölzdözős. 

52
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,094
 The game designers have ever played Contra with? 

53
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:21,158
 Can you imagine how much that it causes problems that you can not shoot while jumping? 

54
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,429
 However, the biggest problem is that there is no possibility to continue. 

55
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:28,738
 If you die three times, the game character from the start. 

56
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,875
 It's that simple! 

57
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,756
 You better get used to the first scenario, 

58
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,051
 because often you'll see a whore! 

59
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,925
 The other big problem is that if you want to jump onto something 

60
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,270
 Ates then on it! 

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,783
 This inspriráló a very bad joke, legendarily bad game design. 

62
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:47,322
 Almost as bad as the Wizard of Oz. 

63
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,533
 Fucked up the injury. 

64
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,577
 If you want to shoot something, the bullet passes through it until you're perfectly correct. 

65
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:57,091
 This game is like a frustrated child who must leave to win! 

66
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:00,325
 To get rid of these automatic lövegektől, 

67
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,666
 it is best to use grenades. 

68
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,549
 But grenades only find the first parts of the channel. 

69
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,143
 Then, when you run out, fucked up! 

70
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:13,281
 At this point two guns at the same time have to handle. 

71
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:15,182
 Only some of them kill a separation, 

72
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,392
 therefore, the second to hit for sure you're going to get! 

73
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,675
 No matter how far you get, you still do not have the possibility to continue. 

74
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:25,706
 To my knowledge, there is no code, it does not even GameGenie to. Nothing! 

75
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,865
 The only way to végigvidd is not to fuck it! 

76
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,014
 As outrageous 

77
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:34,130
 However, 50,000 points, you get an extra life 

78
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,514
 Fair enough, so I'll stay here, and while I shoot this prick until it happens. 

79
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:43,351
 The enemies respawn, so it's not a challenge to stay in one place 

80
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,105
 and collecting goods points. 

81
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:49,122
 The only downside is that for a very long time to do it. 

82
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:09,137
 Finally, Extra Life. 

83
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:12,997
 From now on I will be very careful, because I do not want my work to go to waste so far. 

84
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:15,567
 Here's the fucking slime, you just do not pay attention ... 

85
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,389
 Awww, my God! 

86
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,230
 The only hope is if you spend many hours extra life by collecting as possible. 

87
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,637
 Quickly you can lose them, but you need at least to get new ones. 

88
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,362
 You who have enough patience for this? 

89
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,642
 No emulátorokról and job-saving we are talking about. 

90
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:37,057
 I'm talking about reality, when you sit in front of your TV, and holding down the A button. 

91
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:41,081
 Sounds good, does not it? But check this out! I have an idea! 

92
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:48,055
 Get a wrench or something, tighten down the A button 

93
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,238
 There you go! 

94
00:05:51,238 --> 00:05:54,860
 Just sit back and do nothing fucking! 

95
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,076
 "I'll be back!" 

96
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,959
 Look at that! My life is already 6. 

97
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,086
 Now I go to bed, then come back and everything will be maximum. 

98
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:20,190
 Right, what was a good idea? But wait. I have a better idea! 

99
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,601
 There could be some fucking Resume! 

100
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:27,944
 Wrench to make the controller ... I want to do it all your life? 

101
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:30,867
 It's pointless. But to do this, man. 

102
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:50,411
 All right! I'm back! Fresh and fresh and, 

103
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,827
 ready to continue to play the terminator, and the extra life with. 

104
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:55,550
 Each of the six ... 

105
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,598
 Six? 

106
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:01,057
 Only six? 

107
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:03,988
 Okay I'll be honest. 

108
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:06,507
 Only one figure, I did not expect more than nine. 

109
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,735
 But why such a random number, like six? 

110
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:12,124
 This means having something fucked up masochistic 

111
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:15,627
 so programmed, and while this decision was made by: 

112
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:20,976
 "Let's see. We do not make more than six, because many will be. " Fucking asshole! 

113
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:23,089
 The only thing I can think of for now, 

114
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,898
 to die five times and start over again. 

115
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:30,322
 Then, suddenly, or a flatbed car, fireballs rain on you. 

116
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:34,379
 Only very little you can control the car, so the only thing you'll ever do 

117
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,014
 to die, you die, you die. 

118
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:40,613
 You can not hit because the projectile is scattered everywhere. 

119
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,769
 Eventually outpace the fucking machine. 

120
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:47,649
 But start immediately after you shoot a tank-metal monster simplicity. 

121
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,620
 At this point, just get inside the balls. 

122
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,377
 The only thing to do is hit, then again, again and again. 

123
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:57,416
 This part of the game again with a death trap. 

124
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,476
 Do you see what happened? Extra életeimmel? 

125
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:00,108
 They're gone! 

126
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,016
 And, unfortunately, are no longer adversaries. 

127
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,285
 So now it is hopeless me to get them again. 

128
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,586
 If you die, the game is over. 

129
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,156
 But here's the most annoying thing I've ever seen. 

130
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,004
 The spears no rhythm, just randomly show up. 

131
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,375
 So I must be lucky! 

132
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,461
 Look at those projections! They could be even smaller? 

133
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,180
 To think how hard it had been to finish touching 

134
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,595
 then try to imagine how crazy that is exactly halfway arrive 

135
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:27,305
 a place that is narrower than the character itself! 

136
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:33,071
 If you arrive on your foot, it does not matter. Must arrive at the empty space that is between your legs. 

137
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,370
 Fuck! 

138
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,910
 Okay, life is zero, so there is still a chance. 

139
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,514
 Skip ... 

140
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:40,274
 Skip ... 

141
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:42,379
 Skip ... 

142
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:45,419
 Fuck! 

143
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:52,278
 Fucking small! Fucking small! 

144
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,812
 "I was devastated!" 

145
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:06,658
 I can not believe that they were able to issue such a big shit NES 

146
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,741
 Moreover, in 1992. 

147
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:10,524
 1992nd Demeberében. 

148
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:12,041
 Well, it has been released for the Super Nintendo. 

149
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:17,393
 While we're here, let's look at the 16-bit version! 

150
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,033
 Thank goodness it's not the same game improved graphics. 

151
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,178
 This is completely different 

152
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:29,840
 However, I'm thinking that was used in the opening screen of the movie 

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,049
 but not the music. The music is the final confrontation. 

154
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,945
 It's like the Star Wars overture to use, but other music. 

155
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:50,711
 So you can not find one of these games, the Terminator-Original Song. 

156
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:54,619
 Once again, Kyle Reese or you're not in the sewers, but on the battlefield or 

157
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,101
 as seen in the movie visszaelékezésekben. 

158
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,982
 So we headed in the right direction! 

159
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:04,166
 The firing is much better. In this case, you normally shoot, 

160
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,166
 instead should squat. 

161
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,698
 Even the ladders can shoot too, which is pretty cool. 

162
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:14,120
 But what sucks, is that you can not shoot straight up or toward the ground. 

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,530
 There is no more perfect example of the Contra-Series takes. 

164
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,375
 Can shoot every fucking direction and challenging games to date. 

165
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:26,371
 But here fennakadsz those foes, you just find a grenade. 

166
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,927
 If you run out of grenades, fucked! 

167
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,928
 If you want to do a game in which you can not shoot toward the ground, 

168
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:35,913
 then do not do it any enemies that are in the fucking ground! 

169
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:38,195
 The graphics in the foreground are always in the way. 

170
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:41,919
 How fair is that you can barely see the enemy? 

171
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,409
 Otherwise, what the fuck are they? Decepticon-ballers? (The evil Decepticons in the Transformers-franchisee) 

172
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:49,592
 Look, I hit my head, and died. 

173
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,089
 It is quite surprising, but the game is quite difficult. 

174
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,207
 Now I can imagine what you had to kereszülmenni Reesenek Kyle and Johnny C's. 

175
00:10:56,207 --> 00:11:01,480
 Keep running to a deserted area where machines are around, throwing grenades and shooting at you from left and right. 

176
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,402
 Crap shoot at you from the sky, the earth shit, shit everywhere! 

177
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:09,039
 You're going to be destroyed! Those films were not realistic. 

178
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,318
 There is no way to survive. 

179
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:13,288
 But the part-time occupancy vehicles, that's fine. 

180
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:17,647
 Look at the balls! No recurring schedule, and it's like a different player to control. 

181
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:25,499
 Time to react before it will appear on the terminator, and shoot at you. 

182
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:29,880
 It is quite difficult to transcend slowly, if your character can only run. 

183
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,746
 The only strategy is to crouch and move along 

184
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:34,620
 But even then, - it is still getting hit - half the time. 

185
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,792
 Not as often as you find it so far, but enough to die. 

186
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:43,181
 And just get him alive. If you run out of - you guessed it already ... 

187
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:47,815
 Proceed no. But it's okay because I did not finish the first level. 

188
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:52,861
 Do not seem difficult. But good heavens! It just goes on and on and on! 

189
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:56,572
 Five life and healing packages could not get on. 

190
00:11:57,572 --> 00:12:01,476
 I got the car for a turn, which still belongs to the first scenario, 

191
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:04,287
 but this is worse than the NES diversified car parts! 

192
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:08,889
 I can shoot in three directions, which means that you can not hit this thing, if it does not come irányaidba. 

193
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,918
 And there's nothing there, which defend yourself. 

194
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:14,711
 You can not move around and get results from these explosive bowling ball from. 

195
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:18,519
 Finally disappears, and you can run out again. 

196
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,549
 After such a big sprint already think that the thing was probably the main enemy. 

197
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,562
 No, do not be naive! 

198
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:27,341
 Just keep doing the shitty ending marathon 

199
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,702
 which crap shoot, shoot at you and shit! 

200
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:32,466
 Finally, you arrive at the main enemy. 

201
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:36,826
 Large enough to be Boss, and so long as it did to get here 

202
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:38,157
 I can say that he is the Boss. 

203
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,923
 Die! Die! Okay, got it. 

204
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:43,932
 But now .. 

205
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:44,452
 What is it? 

206
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:46,817
 Now you fucking kidding me? 

207
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:52,548
 (That's the part that you think is impossible to translate into Hungarian ...) 

208
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:53,971
 That it is not over yet? 

209
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:58,000
 Yet how long can the first track? Unless the whole game is not like that ... 

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,187
 I can not fucking believe it! 

211
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:03,650
 Finally, I died like everyone else. 

212
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,732
 The end of the game, the first track is infinite, can not be transferred, and the story is that it is impossible to play. 

213
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,001
 Very quick peek at the Terminator Sega CD. 

214
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,750
 I've spoken a few words about the Sega CD in my video, 

215
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,529
 but now as I look at this huge improvement over the previous games. 

216
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,438
 There are some annoying things. 

217
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,559
 As in previous games, here are some directions which you can not shoot, 

218
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,333
 This makes it quite difficult to find an angle in which you hit the enemies. 

219
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,195
 I do not know why, but it seems that only the Contra has managed to achieve that. 

220
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:41,692
 Sometimes it is quite confusing to figure out which way to go. 

221
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:46,292
 And then there are the bushings from the film unwatchable, which is characteristic of the Sega CD. 

222
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:51,293
 In dreams would have thought that one day we can look better quality videos on the Internet! 

223
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:57,158
 But you can skip these vias, otherwise the game is a side-scrolling pretty good stuff. 

224
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,740
 And also includes the Terminator theme. 

225
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,567
 In addition, lots of great music! 

226
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,515
 God, this is fucking great! 

227
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:15,048
 Just a little bit better in the NES version, do not you think? 

228
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:21,616
 Well, from now things will only get better. 

229
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:26,668
 The second movie was better than the first, so I can expect from this game. 

230
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:30,008
 I believe that light waiting at the end of the tunnel. Survive the storm, 

231
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:33,113
 and there will be a rainbow after the storm. 

232
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:34,181
 A heart ..? 

233
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:35,365
 Oh, no! 

234
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:46,337
 Continued ... 

235
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:54,000
